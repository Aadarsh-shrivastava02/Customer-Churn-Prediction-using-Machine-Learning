# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) using historical data from a bank. By applying machine learning techniques, we build a classification model that identifies at-risk customers, helping businesses take proactive steps to retain them.

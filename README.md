# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) using historical data from a bank. By applying machine learning techniques, we build a classification model that identifies at-risk customers, helping businesses take proactive steps to retain them.

Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical issue for subscription-based businesses like banks, telecoms, and SaaS companies. Losing existing customers impacts revenue more than acquiring new ones. The goal is to create a predictive model based on customer attributes (such as credit score, geography, account balance, tenure, etc.) to identify those likely to churn.
